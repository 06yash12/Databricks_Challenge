# Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge
Excited to be joining the Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge by Indian Data Club!
I’m looking forward to strengthening my fundamentals in Databricks, Apache Spark, and real‑world data engineering workflows through hands‑on learning. Excited to learn, build, and grow alongside the community over the next 14 days.

Grateful for the support and initiative by Databricks, Codebasics, and Indian Data Club.

• Apache Spark architecture (Driver, Executors, DAG)
• Difference between DataFrames and RDDs
• Concept of lazy evaluation in Spark
• Usage of notebook magic commands (%sql, %python, %fs)

Tasks I Completed:
• Uploaded a sample e‑commerce CSV file
• Read data into Spark DataFrames
• Performed basic operations like select, filter, groupBy, and orderBy
• Exported processed results
